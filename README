Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------

    The approximation of the probability of ruin using the method of
upper and lower bounds does not provide the correct results if the
integrated tail area distribution function is not supplied.  More
specifically, the less accurate bounds avoiding integration are not yet
correctly implemented.

    Models without oscillation are currently not supported.  At the
moment, there is no guarantee that the functions provided in this
package provide sensible output (or, for that matter, any output at all)
if variance = 0.
